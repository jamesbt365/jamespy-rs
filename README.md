# jamespy

A reimplementation of [jamespy](https://github.com/jamesbt365/jamespy), a spy/utility bot, now in rust using the [poise](https://github.com/serenity-rs/poise) library.

This is actually more usable than the original project, though my scuffed basic knowledge of rust can only go so far, so the code isn't amazing or anything.
